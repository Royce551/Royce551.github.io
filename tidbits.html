                I was mainly inspired to start writing GUI apps by the <a href="https://crystalmark.info/en/">Shizuku editions</a> of
                Crystal Dew World's software, which includes prominent anime character themes and sounds. The concept's pretty funny
                and I wanted to make more apps like that :p

                Apart from programming, I am also super interested in learning to draw and perhaps produce music in the future. I'm also
                interested in everything infrastructure, like roads, railways, and airports.

                I love songs from pretty much every genre. I genuinely couldn't tell you what my favorite song or genre is.

                My favorite games include Minecraft, Cities: Skylines, and osu!.

                My current PC has been in service since late 2018. It has an i5 8400, a GTX 1050Ti, and 8 GB of RAM.
