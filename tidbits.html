                I was mainly inspired to start writing GUI apps by the <a href="https://crystalmark.info/en/">Shizuku editions</a> of
                Crystal Dew World's software, which includes prominent anime character themes and sounds. The concept's pretty funny
                and I wanted to make more apps like that :p

                Apart from programming, I am also super interested in learning to draw and perhaps produce music in the future. I'm also
                interested in everything infrastructure, like roads, railways, and airports.

            <li>
                I love songs from pretty much every genre. I genuinely couldn't tell you what my favorite song or genre is.

            <li>
                My favorite games include Minecraft, Cities: Skylines, and osu!.
