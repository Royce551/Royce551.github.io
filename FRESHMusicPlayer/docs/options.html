<p>FMP has a few settings that you can access by clicking the gear icon on the Navbar.</p>

<h1>General</h1>
<p>Language - Displays a list of languages to select. Choose "automatic" if you want to use the system language.</p>
<p>
    Playtime Logging - Whether FMP should keep track of what tracks you've played over time. You can later view
    the log using <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/767873936272523274/793681764555554836/FMP.Favorites-v1.zip">FRESHMusicPlayer.Favorites (400KB)</a>
</p>

<h3>Integration</h3>
<p>Discord Rich Presence - Whether FMP will show the playing track and status in your Discord presence</p>
<p>
    System Transport Controls - Whether FMP will integrate with Windows 10. This lets you control FMP with 
    the media keys on your keyboard and see what you're playing in the lock screen, for example. No effect on Windows 8.1 or older.
</p>

<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>Auto Update Mode - How FMP will deal with updates:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prompt before updating - Updates will be automatically downloaded, but you'll be asked to restart FMP.</li>
    <li>Automatic - Once the update has been downloaded and installed, FMP will restart automatically.</li>
    <li>Manual - FMP won't check for updates automatically; you'll have to press the check for updates button yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since FMP updates are tiny (&lt; 100KB), you should probably leave this on Prompt.</p>

<h1>Appearance</h1>
<p>
    Show time instead of title in window title - Whether the track position will be shown in the window title instead of the track title.
    This can be useful if you have taskbar labels enabled.
</p>
<p>Theme - The color theme FMP will use.</p>

<h1>Maintenance</h1>
<p>Reset settings to default - Resets all settings to defaults.</p>
<p>Clean and update library - Updates metadata for all tracks in the library and removes duplicate tracks. Useful if you edited metadata using an external tool.</p>
<p>Nuke library - Removes all tracks in the library.</p>
