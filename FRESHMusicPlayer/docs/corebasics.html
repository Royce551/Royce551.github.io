<p>Most of FMP Core's functionality is contained in the Player class.</p>

    <code>
        using FRESHMusicPlayer;

        var player = new Player();
        var path = "Can be a file path or URL to a network stream";
        player.Queue.Add(path); // Everything in FMP runs on a queue
        player.PlayMusic(); // Begin playing through the queue
                            // Note: This is not blocking!

        player.PlayMusic(path); // If you're playing only one track, this is a shortcut for
                                // clearing the queue, adding the path to the queue, and then playing.

        player.Volume = 0.5f;
        player.CurrentTime = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10); // Seek 10 seconds into the track
        Console.WriteLine(player.TotalTime.ToString()); // Get the total length of the playing track
        Console.WriteLine(player.FilePath) // Get the path of the track FMP is currently playing

        player.PauseMusic(); // Pause
        player.ResumeMusic(); // Resume the paused track
        player.NextSong(); // Skip next
        player.StopMusic(); // Completely stop and clean up
