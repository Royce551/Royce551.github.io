<p>The library represents your music collection.</p>

<h1>Add stuff</h1>
<p>There's 2 ways to add stuff to the library</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Drag and Drop</p>
        <p>
            You can drag and drop a file or folder to import it. Be careful not to drop
            it into the controls box; that'll play it without importing!
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Import Page</p>
        <p>
            The Import page offers a variety of ways to add tracks to your library.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>Play stuff</h1>
<p>The Tracks, Artists, Albums, and Playlists pages provide a variety of ways to view your library.</p>
<p>
    In the Artists, Albums, and Playlists pages, the pane on the left selects the artist, album, or playlist
    you want. You can also drag the edge to make it larger, if you need to.

<p>
    The bar on the bottom shows how many tracks are displayed, followed by how long all of them are.
