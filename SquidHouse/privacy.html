    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Your privacy's super important to us. If you have any concerns or complaints about the way we handle privacy, or if
        you'd like to exercise your legal rights, feel free to shoot an email to <a href="mailto:poohwie2005@gmail.com">poohwie2005@gmail.com</a>. 
        All of our apps are also open source and you're more than welcome to look at our 
        <a href="https://github.com/royce551">source code</a> and vet the truthiness of this document!
    </p>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>
        Squid Grill applications do not transmit information to any servers, except to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> for
        providing automatic updates on Windows (which can be disabled by setting the update mode to Manual), and when specified in
        the application and enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some Squid Grill applications, such as FRESHMusicPlayer, collect some information to help personalize your experience - this
        all happens on device and is never sent anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you get choose Discogs or MusicBrainz as a tag source, FRESHMusicPlayer will share the album you entered with the
            respective database to get the appropiate metadata.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Services</h2>
    <p>
        If you use Squid Grill services, some data is collected so that we can provide you with that service. All of our servers
        are located in Canada.
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
            If you interact with ShrimpBot, it will store your publically available Discord user ID so that it can remember you in the
            future. Your username might also be displayed in, for example, leaderboards.
            </p>
            <p>
            Also, we log when commands are executed and where they were executed from for diagnostics and analytics purposes. No message
            content is stored and the log is cleared every time ShrimpBot restarts (typically every month). This log is only viewable by
            bot administrators.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
