        <h2>Technologies I've used</h2>
        <h3>.NET</h3>
        <small>Intermediate, since 2019</small>
        <p>
            Most of my apps are made with C#. I'm most experienced working on the frontend with XAML UI frameworks like
            WPF and Avalonia, although I also endeavor to learn more about the back end of things in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>Web development</h3>
        <small>Beginner, since 2021</small>
        <p>
            This is actually my first website. It is made with plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with Jekyll, but I do
            eventually want to delve deeper into the world of webdev, for better or worse.
        </p>

        <h3>UI design</h3>
        <small>Intermediate, since 2019</small>
        <p>
            I've been making my own GUI apps since 2019 and making UI concepts since before then.
            Most of my apps are built around SIADL, my design language that aims to strike the right balance 
            between user friendliness and utilitarianism.
        </p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <small>Beginner, since 2017</small>
        <p>
            Python was the first programming language I used between 2017 and 2019. I was never particularly proficient at
            it, even back in the day.
        </p>

        <h2>Software I've used</h2>
        <h3>Visual Studio</h3>
        <small>since 2019, for coding my apps</small>
        <h3>Adobe XD</h3>
        <small>since 2018, for creating icons and logos, and, very occasionally, to make UI concepts</small>
