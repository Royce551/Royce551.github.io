        <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a big fan of trains, planes, highways, and other things that keep us moving. Which is probably why I spend most of my spare time playing
            Cities: Skylines, or building large transport systems in Minecraft.

        <h2>Art</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a more visual kind of person where I create characters, songs, and other concepts in my head. I'm thinking about learning how to draw
            or make music so that someday I could put some of these ideas down to paper. Who knows?

<h1>Skills</h1>

<h1>C#</h1>

<h4>WinForms - since 2019</h4>
<p>My first .NET apps were made using WinForms. I don't use it as often anymore, except for tiny utilities.</p>

<h4>WPF - since 2020</h4>
<p>WPF is the UI framework I make most of my apps in, and I'm fairly comfortable with it now.</p>

<h4>Avalonia - since 2021</h4>
<p>
    Avalonia is a relatively new UI framework that I'm learning in order to make cross platform apps. Because it uses very similar concepts to WPF,
    most of my skills transfer, but there are still differences that I haven't gotten used to yet.
</p>

<h2>Python - since 2017</h2>
<p>
    Python is the language I learned serious programming in. I wasn't good at all during my first few years, but it eventually clicked around 2019.
    I'm still not great at Python, as I moved on to C# before finally figuring out how OOP worked.
</p>

<h2>Web Development - since 2021</h2>
<p>
    This website marks my first time doing web development. As you can tell by the janky formatting, I'm definitely not a profressional yet. 
</p>

<h2>Design - since 2016</h2>
<p>
    While I'm not sure I can consider myself good at it yet, I enjoy making logos, banners, and such. I also like to make simple, fast, to-the-point UIs.
    I'm currently working on my UI design language, SIADL ([S]IADL [I]s [A] [D]esign [L]anguage).
